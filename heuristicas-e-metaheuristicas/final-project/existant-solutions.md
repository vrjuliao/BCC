# CVRP soltuions

*Two metaâ€‘heuristics for solving the capacitated vehicle routing problem: the
case of the Tunisian Post Office*, Sbai et al, 2019.

## Objective function
pages 7 and 8 for the paper define the objective function and its variables.


## Proposed solution
**Hybrid GA-VNS**: A genetic algorithm together a VNS approach solving the
problem.
It runs the GA as the main algorithm and uses the VNS procedure as a mutation
operator for improving individuals in the population with a mutation rate equal
to 0,20.
